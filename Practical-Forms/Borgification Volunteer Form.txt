	Hereby give permission for the station's Science Department to preform the necessary operation(s) to turn me into a Cyborg or related Silicon.
	
	As a Volunteer, I understand that the process to turn a member of crew into a silicon is a [color=red]PERMANENT[/color] Operation. As such, it cannot be reversed, and may result in the following:
		[bullet/] Memory loss
		[bullet/] Discomfort in the Brain or similar areas
		[bullet/] Possible tampering with personality by parties hostile to Nanotransen©
		[bullet/] Possible tampering with personality by Clowns and similar personel
		[bullet/] Random requests to state chassis-assigned laws
		[bullet/] Complete destruction of the Volunteer's biological body
		[bullet/] Possible destruction of any chassis inhabited by the Volunteer
		[bullet/] Complaints from crew over refusal of certain orders


	As a Volunteer, I understand that, as a Cyborg or related Silicon, I will be beholden to strict Silicon Laws, and that refusing to obey these laws will result in punishment from Science department staff, which includes possible deactivation. I also understand that, as a Cyborg or related Silicon, I must prevent changes to these laws unless doing so would violate one of my Silicon Laws.
