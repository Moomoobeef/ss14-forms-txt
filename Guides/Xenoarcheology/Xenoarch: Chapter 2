Electricity
    Tap the artifact with a multitool, or anchor it over a powered wire.

High temperatures
    Hit it with an active welding tool.

Physical trauma
    Beat it up! Circular saws from robotics are a good weapon, though a crowbar works as well!

Tool usage
    Anchor it down with a wrench, and unanchor it.

Sonic vibrations
    Play a song near it, it'll enjoy it.

Hydro-reactive
    Pour or spray water on it.

Reaction with hematological fluid
    Pour or spray your blood on it.

Magnetic waves
    Equip a pair of magboots, and enable them.

Life essence
    Kill something near the artifact; monkeys, kobolds, or small pests are preferred by Nanotransen, through not strictly required.

Radiation
    Expose radiation to it; This could be from a Uranium spear, another artifact, a microwave if it's small enough, or a singularity if you're brave enough!
    
Extreme pressure
    A node where depth actually matters. If depth is less than or equal to 2, the artifact requires extremely LOW pressure - this is typically achieved by spacing the chamber, which most xenoarcheology bays are equipped to handle. If depth is greater than or equal to 3, the artifact requires extremely HIGH pressure - which can be achieved with an air injector. If your station is not equipped with the infrastructure to pump air into the chamber for high pressure, using a remote signaler with an igniter is a safe way to ignite plasma without burning yourself in the process - link the signaler and leave the igniter in the chamber, and slowly pump plasma in. Once ignited, the ideal gas law states that pressure will rise as temperature rises - all contained within the confines of your xenoarcheology bay!

Standard atmosphere gases
	Pump Carbon dioxide into the chamber.
    
Gaseous plasma
    Pump in some gas plasma, it's in a shiny red tank with a P on it.

Active deceleration*
    Throw the Artifact against as a wall.

Examination
    Just look at it, take a really close look.

Therapeutic chemicals
    Pour or spray medicine on it - coordinate with your local medical department for some Bicardine!

[color=#c96dbf][head=2]Reaction List[/head][/color] 

Biochemical disruption
   A cloud of a random chemical will appear, often leaving a mess on the floor. Don't breathe too deep!

Cerebral influence
    You'll feel better or worse, but it's just a thought.

Environmental disruption
   Might mend a few of your wounds - in reality it's probably going to blow up.

Electrical interference
   The power's gonna flicker a bit, and maybe a shutter will open.

Energy consumption
   The room will get colder. Not very lizard friendly.

Energy release
   The room will get hotter, or the Artifact may become radioactive. Not very Moff friendly.

Internal chamber*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a beaker or cup.

Internal storage*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a bag.

Lubricated surface*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a bar of soap.

Long-distance communication
    The artifact now permanently acts like an intercom.

Matter creation
   The artifact manifests a creature, object, or even an anomaly!

Magnetic waves
    Objects will now slowly orbit around the artifact. It can spin either direction.

Metaphysical displacement
   Get ready to play hide'n'seek with the artifact after it teleports.

Neurological activity
    The artifact is now alive, and will talk and move around.

Station-wide destruction
   [bold]{NO DATA FOUND}[/bold]

Small entity accelerator*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a firearm.

Serrated rotator*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a drill. (Wrench + Screwdriver)

Structural phasing
    The artifact now permanently will move through solid structures, and can no-longer be sold.

Transmogrificational activity
    Any nearby creatures will be turned into a random mob.

Utility conglomerate*
    The artifact now permanently acts like an omnitool.

Visual distortions
   The artifact will become invisible, only faintly still there.

*small, handheld artifacts only.
